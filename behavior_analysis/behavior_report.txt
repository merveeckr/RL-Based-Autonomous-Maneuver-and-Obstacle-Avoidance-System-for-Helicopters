    Similarity:            46.8%

2. FLIGHT DYNAMICS
------------------
Average Speed: 28.82 m/s
Max Speed: 46.05 m/s
Roll Stability (avg |roll|): 5.00°
Pitch Stability (avg |pitch|): 3.54°
Altitude Variance: 19.39m

3. BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT
----------------------
❌ Agent technical behavior DIFFERS from real helicopter.
   Significant improvements needed.

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------
- Improve roll angle control for more realistic banking
- Improve pitch angle control for more realistic climbing/descending
- Improve altitude rate control for smoother altitude changes

5. LOG DATA USAGE
-----------------
Current log data provides:
- Realistic initial states (attitude, velocity)
- Real helicopter flight patterns for comparison
- Validation baseline for agent behavior

To improve agent behavior:
- Use more diverse log data (different flight scenarios)
- Increase training time with log data initialization
- Fine-tune reward function to encourage realistic dynamics
- Focus on matching angular rates and attitude stability
